    <h2>Pam Worsham</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Pam, a 53 year old mother of three. I have been married for 31 years to my amazing husband Keith. We met through a blind date when we were 18 years old. We were married two years later and started a family right away. Together we have, Ashleigh, 31, and her husband Jake, they live in Utah. Ryan is 26 and married to his high school sweetheart, Juli after serving his mission in Brazil. Tyler is 23 and after serving his mission in California he finished his degree at UVU and opened an Architect Design business. Family is very important to me and I love that two of my three children live close to my husband and I in Georgia. 
   </p>
   <p> My husband and I both decided to start school together. Keith owns a landscape business and would like to change his career. I have always had a desire to achieve a degree that would open windows and opportunities. We figured if one of us was going to go through this process why not both of us. We love that we can be there to support each other.</p> 
    <p>We welcome and thank you for your support through this process!</p>
