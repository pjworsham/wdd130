          Fall festival events are an exciting and a spirited part of the autumn season, offering a wide range of
          activities and adventures for people of all ages to enjoy. One of the beauties of living in the foothills of
          the North Georgia Mountains, we enjoy the harvest season as we welcome and celebrate the transition from
          summer to autumn with the changing colors of leaves and the crisp cool air.

          One such festival is the Etowah River Park Fall Festival, which invites you to join in the celebration of
          autumn. This vibrant event takes place on Saturday (9 am – 6 pm) and Sunday (9 am – 5 pm) from October 21 to
          October 22, 2023, at the picturesque Etowah River Park located at 600 Brown Industrial Parkway in Canton, GA
          30114. The festival is open to all and requires a $7 donation per person aged 11 and up for admission. All
          proceeds raised during the festival go toward supporting local children in need.

          At the Etowah River Park Fall Festival, you can expect to find over 25,000 patrons, more than 150 arts crafts
          exhibitors, several concessionaires, and a host of engaging activities. The festival is a fantastic
          opportunity to immerse yourself in the spirit of fall and make memories with your friends and family. Fall
          into Fun at Our Festival!
