      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My plan is to have three pages that include a home page, vendors page, and events page. Each page will have information pertaining to the headline of the page. Pages will be informative as to what will be happening during the Fall Festival. I have not included the layout yet as to how the information will be displayed. This is only a rough draft as it may change as I move forward with ideas.
        
        Fall festival events are an exciting and a spirited part of the autumn season, offering a wide range of activities and adventures for people of all ages to enjoy. One of the beauties of living in the foothills of the North Georgia Mountains, we enjoy the harvest season as we welcome and celebrate the transition from summer to autumn with the changing colors of leaves and the crisp cool air.

        One such festival is the Etowah River Park Fall Festival, which invites you to join in the celebration of autumn. This vibrant event takes place on Saturday (9 am – 6 pm) and Sunday (9 am – 5 pm) from October 21 to October 22, 2023, at the picturesque Etowah River Park located at 600 Brown Industrial Parkway in Canton, GA 30114. The festival is open to all and requires a $7 donation per person aged 11 and up for admission. All proceeds raised during the festival go toward supporting local children in need.

        At the Etowah River Park Fall Festival, you can expect to find over 25,000 patrons, more than 150 arts crafts exhibitors, several concessionaires, and a host of engaging activities. The festival is a fantastic opportunity to immerse yourself in the spirit of fall and make memories with your friends and family. Fall into Fun at Our Festival!

      <p>
        The Etowah River Park Fall Festival caters to families and kids with an engaging array of activities designed to bring joy and excitement to the youngest festival attendees. Children can enjoy a range of games and amusements that support the season and the spirit of fun.

        Face painting is a popular attraction, allowing kids to choose from their favorite animals, superheroes, or spooky creatures.

        The festival’s animal petting zoo is a hands-on experience with friendly and furry animals. Young ones can interact with goats, rabbits, and other adorable farm animals.

        Hayrides provide an autumn adventure for everyone to enjoy, taking a scenic tour of the festival grounds, while you enjoy looking at the scarecrows through out the grounds that were created by local businesses. 

        The Halloween costume parade is a highlight for little ones who love to dress up. They can showcase their creative costumes and join the parade.

        The corn maze is an exciting challenge for kids to find their way through the twists and turns of this fun adventure.

        One of the highlights of the festival is the extensive array of vendors who line the bank of the Etowah River Park. These exhibitors offer a diverse selection of handmade and hand-decorated items. You can explore a wide range of offerings, including paintings photographs, wood crafts, pottery and glassware, furniture, floral arrangements and decorative accessories, baskets, adult and children’s clothing, doll clothes and toys, jewelry, candles, soap and more. What sets this festival apart is its commitment to featuring only items that are crafted with care and creativity.
